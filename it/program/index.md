State of the Map 2018 is taking place from **July 28th to 30th 2018** in Milan, Italy. We are looking forward to designing a program with you - the OpenStreetMap community. Expect a call for session proposals to go out soon - <a href="{{site.baseurl}}">sign up for event updates</a> to get a notification.

In the meantime, here is the outline of the program:

- July 28th: first main conference day with presentations and discussions
- July 29th: second main conference day with presentations and discussions
- July 30th: activity day with code, documentation sprints, mapping and workshops

We plan to have two tracks of talks throughout the first two days, with the option to expand to three tracks for a half day of academic talks. Breakout rooms will be available throughout.
