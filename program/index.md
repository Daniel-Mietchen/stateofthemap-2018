State of the Map 2018 is taking place from **July 28th to 30th 2018** in Milan, Italy. We are looking forward to designing a program with you - the OpenStreetMap community. Update: The call for session proposals has now closed and we are working hard to score and select the talks.

In the meantime, here is the outline of the program:

- July 28th: first main conference day with keynote speech, presentations, workshops and evening social event
- July 29th: second main conference day with presentations, workshops and an academic track
- July 30th: either a third day or join activities or an activity day with code, documentation sprints, mapping and workshops

There will be plenty of breakout rooms throughout for discussions, code, documentation sprints, mapping and workshops. <a href="https://2018.stateofthemap.org/academictrack/">Academic talks</a> will be included this year and will most likely be between half a day and a full day on July 29th.
