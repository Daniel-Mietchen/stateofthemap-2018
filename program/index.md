State of the Map 2018 is taking place from **July 28th to 30th 2018** in Milan, Italy. We are looking forward to designing a program with you - the OpenStreetMap community. You only have until 14th February to <a href="https://blog.openstreetmap.org/2018/01/11/session-proposals-sotm-2018/">submit your session proposals</a> and until 4th March to <a href="https://2018.stateofthemap.org/academictrack/">submit your academic abstract</a> so don't delay!

In the meantime, here is the outline of the program:

- July 28th: first main conference day with presentations and discussions
- July 29th: second main conference day with presentations and discussions
- July 30th: activity day with code, documentation sprints, mapping and workshops

We plan to have two tracks of talks throughout the first two days, with the option to expand to three tracks for a half day of <a href="https://2018.stateofthemap.org/academictrack/">academic talks</a>. Breakout rooms will be available throughout.

*Your State of the Map organizing team.*
