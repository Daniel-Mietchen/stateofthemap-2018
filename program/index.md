State of the Map 2018 is taking place from **July 28th to 30th 2018** in Milan, Italy. We are looking forward to designing a program with you - the OpenStreetMap community. Update: We have completed the selection process and are currently working towards a full day by day schedule.

In the meantime, here is the outline of the program:

- July 28th: first day with keynote speech, presentations, workshops and evening social event
- July 29th: second day of the conference with presentations, workshops and an academic track
- July 30th: a third day or joint activities finishing with our closing session

There will be plenty of breakout rooms throughout for discussions, code, documentation sprints, mapping and workshops. A full day of <a href="https://2018.stateofthemap.org/academictrack/">academic talks</a> will be included this year.
