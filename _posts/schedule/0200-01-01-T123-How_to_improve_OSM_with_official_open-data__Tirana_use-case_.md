Part 1 by Anisa Kuci: OSM Albania member
In many countries or cities we can find open-data publicly available but it&#39;s not always the case, that&#39;s why Open Labs contacted the Municipality of Tirana to make them open their data and ... it worked !
Even though each country is different, we think it&#39;s usually difficult to connect with officials, especially to promote open-source softwares and open-data, this is how Open Labs community succeeded in both in Tirana.

Part 2 by Jonathan BeliÃ«n: OSM Belgium board member
Once we have open-data available (in many formats), how can we make those data available for the many people who do not have a GIS background ?
The idea we had is to create easy-to-use website and services so anyone can use those data to map in Tirana using their favorite editor (iD, JOSM, ...).
