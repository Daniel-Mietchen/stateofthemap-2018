The session will be an introduction on the Philippine Department of Social Welfare and Development&#39;s (DSWD&#39;s) online interactive platform for accessing maps by its GIS personnel, the DSWD MapViewer (https://maps.dswd.gov.ph). The MapViewer aims to share relevant data and geospatial information to users - from researchers, students, and to those who are looking for information on DSWD&#39;s services and projects. The MapViewer also provides these maps and interactive tools to assist policy and decision-makers to review, affirm, and establish conclusions based on pertinent data.

I hope to show the different maps and data made available using this platform and how it aims to help the policy and decision-makers, as well as those who want to volunteer for social welfare and development work. I hope to also talk about future plans in improving this platform and how to further add data.
