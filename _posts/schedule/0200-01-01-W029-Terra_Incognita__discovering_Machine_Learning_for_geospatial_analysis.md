Real estate prediction, land use classification, places recommendation and human mobility analysis are just a few geospatial domain problems recently swept by Machine Learning approaches. But while coding and computational methodologies are currently part of any GIS/Geospatial analysis curricula, Machine Learning is still a relatively specialised domain.  

In this workshop we aim to demystify its complexity by breaking down from a practical perspective a typical processing pipeline, demonstrating: (i) exploratory data analysis and feature extraction, (ii) problem setup and train &amp; test split, (iii) model selection and evaluation.

This workshop is aimed at beginners in Machine Learning and requires only a general knowledge of programming concepts. We&#39;ll make use of the Python and Javascript programming languages. The workshop code will be released as Jupyter notebooks and be made freely accessible with the datasets after the workshop.
