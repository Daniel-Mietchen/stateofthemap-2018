Organizations such as HOT, Map Kibera, the American Red Cross, the World Bank and many others have in recent years undertaken projects in the international development context that sought to collect map data while at the same time supporting the growth of the local OSM community in the area where the mapping takes places. However, the sustainability of these efforts has been difficult to achieve, in part due to very different formulations of the term and the lack of knowledge sharing on this topic between these organizations. Building on a series of meetings and workshops taking place in early 2018, we propose to host a panel at SOTM 2018 where this issue can be discussed publicly with the larger OpenStreetMap Community. We would share case studies and lessons learned from the Open Cities Project, MapKibera, HOT&#39;s micro-grants program, and others, along with early results of our efforts to systematize the concept of sustainability within this context.
