Last main advances of Osmose-QA: analysis resuming to reduce processing time, switch to Docker to facilitate project contributions. And more over the new support of MapCSS from JOSM validator to set up a common validation framework. Osmose now support MapCSS validation rules from JOSM and Osmose-QA rules can be also partly written in MapCSS and played in JOSM.
