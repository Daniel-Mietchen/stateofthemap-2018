OSM has become already an influencing global data tank,  a beacon for the advocacy of the reality of those left behind. Amazingly, our database has a great diversity of layers, including many related to the Sustainable Development Goals, like those related to poverty , education, health , transport and land planning. However, we still need to work harder to speak for those without a voice on the ground. 

This will be an invigorating session that will identify those citizen centric data sets from OSM that can be used to produce indicators for the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)  and therefore be an aid in the endeavour of fairness and equality they claim, as a crucial part of the &#34; leave no one behind&#34; overall goal established by the UN.

The  talk will analyze layers and databases that can be proposed for the provision  of the measurement of the 17 goals and that could be developed further together with countries lacking the resources to produce this data. The analysis will answer how far have we advanced on the SDGs and what do we still need to improve.
